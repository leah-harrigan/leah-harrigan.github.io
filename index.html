<h4>About</h4>

<p>
I am a Program Manager providing culturally responsive and trauma-informed programming to mentors and youth impacted by foster care at <a href="https://www.silverliningmentoring.org/">Silver Lining Mentoring</a>. My path to the mentoring field was preceded by work at Youth Villages as a masters level clinician and clinical supervisor providing in-home therapy to families in need of emotional and behavioral supports. A former educator with a social service leadership and counseling background, I develop inclusive environments that support a sense of belonging in educational and social service spaces.

<p>
I obtained my M.A. in Child Study and Human Development from Tufts University, where I concentrated in clinical developmental health and psychology. Here I worked as an assistant teacher at the Eliot Pearson Children’s School focusing on children’s social and emotional development. I developed a group-based social skills curriculum for children and teens under short-term residential crisis care at the Walker School and created my capstone project under the advisory of W. George Scarlett. Prior to that, I obtained a B.A. in Psychology from Providence College and spent two years in community service with AmeriCorps in the Providence charter school system, where I implemented social and emotional learning after school programs and expanded my training with community outreach and social justice learning opportunities.

<h4>Interests</h4>

<p>
I’m broadly interested in creating more inclusive and engaging spaces to learn and work. I’m a fierce advocate for social and emotional learning, a lifelong process through which people learn understand and manage emotions, set and achieve goals, feel and show empathy, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.

<p>
My training in child and human development has made it clear that access to social-emotional learning (SEL) opportunities is critical for children and adults alike. SEL leaders like CASEL have provided helpful frameworks and invaluable resources which have informed my work as a teacher, manager, and counselor. Among the learning environments I have taught (classrooms, therapeutic spaces, and mentoring programs), social and emotional intelligence has been key to creating communities for optimum psychological safety. A connector and observer who understands needs and opportunities of educational and social work spaces, I’m interested in cultivating spaces that strengthen a sense of belonging and encourage innovation for meaningful outcomes.
