I'm a Program Manager supporting trauma-informed programming to mentors and youth impacted by foster care at [Silver Lining Mentoring](https://www.silverliningmentoring.org/). Previously, I was a clinician and clinical supervisor [Youth Villages](https://www.youthvillages.org/) providing in-home therapy to families in need of emotional and behavioral supports.

I obtained my M.A. in Child Study and Human Development from [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/epcshd/), where I concentrated in clinical developmental health and psychology. Here I worked as an assistant teacher at the [Eliot Pearson Children’s School](https://sites.tufts.edu/eliotpearsonchildrensschool/) focusing on children’s social and emotional development. I developed a group-based social skills curriculum for children and teens under short-term residential crisis care at the Walker School and created my capstone project under the advisory of [W. George Scarlett](). Prior to that, I obtained a B.A. in Psychology from Providence College and spent two years serving communities with [AmeriCorps](https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps) in the Providence charter school system, where I taught in elementary and middle school classroms.

### Interests

I'm broadly interested in contributing to inclusive and engaging spaces to learn, work, and play. Across environments for both children and adults, my mission has been to help elevate meaningful learning opportunities through education, belonging, and people development. I'm a social dot connector who loves to improve the systems that help people learn and work more efficiently.

I'm a staff writer for [Tomorrow's Earth Stewards](https://sites.tufts.edu/earthstewards/), a resource hub for connecting children to nature and teaching Earth stewardship. On my own time I enjoy writing about social services, belonging, and inclusion at work.
