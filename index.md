I am a Program Manager providing culturally responsive and trauma-informed programming to mentors and youth impacted by foster care at [Silver Lining Mentoring](https://www.silverliningmentoring.org/). My path to the mentoring field was preceded by work at [Youth Villages](https://www.youthvillages.org/) as a masters level clinician and clinical supervisor providing in-home therapy to families in need of emotional and behavioral supports. A former educator with a social service leadership and counseling background, I develop inclusive environments that support a sense of belonging in educational and social service spaces.

I obtained my M.A. in Child Study and Human Development from [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/epcshd/), where I concentrated in clinical developmental health and psychology. Here I worked as an assistant teacher at the [Eliot Pearson Children’s School](https://sites.tufts.edu/eliotpearsonchildrensschool/) focusing on children’s social and emotional development. I developed a group-based social skills curriculum for children and teens under short-term residential crisis care at the Walker School and created my capstone project under the advisory of [W. George Scarlett](). Prior to that, I obtained a B.A. in Psychology from Providence College and spent two years in community service with [AmeriCorps](https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps) in the Providence charter school system, where I implemented social and emotional learning after school programs and expanded my training with community outreach and social justice learning opportunities.

### Interests
I’m broadly interested in creating more inclusive and engaging spaces to learn and work. I’m a fierce advocate for social and emotional learning, a lifelong process through which people learn understand and manage emotions, set and achieve goals, feel and show empathy, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.

My training in child and human development has made it clear that access to social-emotional learning (SEL) opportunities is critical for children and adults alike. SEL leaders like CASEL have provided helpful frameworks and invaluable resources which have informed my work as a teacher, manager, and counselor. Among the learning environments I have taught (classrooms, therapeutic spaces, and mentoring programs), social and emotional intelligence has been key to creating communities for optimum psychological safety. A connector and observer who understands needs and opportunities of educational and social work spaces, I’m interested in cultivating spaces that strengthen a sense of belonging and encourage innovation for meaningful outcomes.
