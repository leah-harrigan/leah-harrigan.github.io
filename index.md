I'm a Program Manager providing culturally responsive and trauma-informed programming to mentors and youth impacted by foster care at [Silver Lining Mentoring](https://www.silverliningmentoring.org/). Previously, I was a clinician and clinical supervisor [Youth Villages](https://www.youthvillages.org/) providing in-home therapy to families in need of emotional and behavioral supports.

I obtained my M.A. in Child Study and Human Development from [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/epcshd/), where I concentrated in clinical developmental health and psychology. Here I worked as an assistant teacher at the [Eliot Pearson Children’s School](https://sites.tufts.edu/eliotpearsonchildrensschool/) focusing on children’s social and emotional development. I developed a group-based social skills curriculum for children and teens under short-term residential crisis care at the Walker School and created my capstone project under the advisory of [W. George Scarlett](). Prior to that, I obtained a B.A. in Psychology from Providence College and spent two years in community service with [AmeriCorps](https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps) in the Providence charter school system, where I taught in elementary-middle school classroms and led after school programming.

### Interests
I’m broadly interested in creating more inclusive and engaging spaces to learn and work. I’m an advocate for social and emotional learning (SEL), a lifelong process through which people learn understand and manage emotions, set and achieve goals, feel and show empathy, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.

My training in human development has made it clear that access to SEL opportunities is critical for children and adults. SEL frameworks have informed my work as a teacher, manager, and counselor. Among the learning environments I've taught (classrooms, therapeutic spaces, and mentoring programs), social and emotional intelligence has been key to optimizing psychological safety. A connector who understands needs and opportunities of educational and social work spheres, I’m interested in cultivating communities that strengthen a sense of belonging for meaningful outcomes.
